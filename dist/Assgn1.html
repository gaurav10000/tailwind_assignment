        cofounded Apple in his parents’ garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985,
        returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in 1997, and by the tine he
        died, in October 2011, had bullt it into the world’s nost valusble
        conpany. Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personal
        computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, retail
        stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of
        Anerica’s great dmovators, along with Thonas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt
        Disney. None of these men was a satnt, but long after thetr personalities

          of the book, | asked him again about his tendency to be rough
          on people. “Look at the results,” he replied. “These are all smart
          people | work with, and any of them could get a top job at
          another place if they were truly feeling brutalized. But they
          don't.” Then he paused for a few moments and said, almost
          wistfully, “And we got some amazing things done.” Indeed, he
          and Apple had had a string of hits over the past dozen years
          that was greater than that of any other innovative company in
          modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores,
          MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion—not to mention
          every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was
          surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had
          been inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and
          four children.</p>
